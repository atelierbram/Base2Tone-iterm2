# Base2Tone iTerm2

Base2Tone-iterm2 – colorschemes for iTerm2 – one of the syntax-highlighting applications containing the colorschemes of [Base2Tone](http://base2t.one) which are based on [Duotone Themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes/) by [Simurai](http://simurai.com/) for Atom.

> “DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (7 shades in total). It tones down less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the important ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.”

Find the colorschemes in the ColorPresets folder.
